        <h2>Three Wise Monkeys and Audiology Awareness Month in October
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Ida Institute has collaborated with the American Academy of Audiology Foundation to create and distribute a poster based on one of the winning ideas from our Ideas Competition: the Three Wise Monkeys.
        </p>
        <p>
            The release of the poster this fall coincides with National Audiology Awareness Month in the United States, which takes place in October. We would like to thank the Oticon Foundation for making this collaboration possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage everyone to use the Three Wise Monkeys poster to raise public awareness of the importance of regular, hearing screenings. The poster can be placed in a variety of different settings, such as hearing clinics, schools, universities, hospitals, and family medical practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please <a href="http://idainstitute.com/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Three%20Monkey%20Poster%20Raise%20Awareness.pdf" title="Initiates file download">download the poster</a> and show your support for making hearing screenings and hearing healthcare a natural part of everyday life.

        <h2>Surveys Show Ida Institute Is Helping to Change Hearing Care Practice
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since its inception in 2008, Ida Institute has worked to make person-centered care the standard in the field of audiology by making it easier, more comfortable and more time realistic for practitioners to bring the patient's perspective into the clinical setting.  Two recent surveys show that Ida is indeed helping to make that goal a reality.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research (KORA) conducted an independent evaluation of the reach and impact of the Ida Institute. Over 500 Ida community members completed the online survey.
        </p>
        <p>
            In May 2013, we initiated a second survey to supplement the KORA report and create a more complete picture of our impact on the hearing care profession. Our goal was to estimate the number of professionals, students, and patients who have been 'touched by Ida'. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The surveys found that thousands of hearing care professionals in practices around the world find the Ida tools and resources valuable in their practice and use the tools on a daily basis to foster more patient-centered care.
        </p>
        <p>
            The survey results provide validation for a shift in clinical practice that has been reported anecdotally by Ida fellows and My Ida members over the past several years.  In 2012, Ida network members reported that they had introduced and presented Ida tools and methods to approximately 4,000 of their fellow hearing care professionals. It is estimated that more than one-half million patients have benefited from the care of clinicians who have received training in Ida Institute patient-centered tools and methods.

        <h2>My World Workshop at the 2013 Frontiers in Hearing Symposium</h2>
        <p>
            Ida senior audiologist Melanie Gregory partnered with pediatric hearing care specialists Christine Yoshinaga-Itano and Eileen Rall to conduct a post-session workshop on the My World pediatric counseling tool at the 2013 Frontiers in Hearing Symposium.  The workshop was part of the bi-annual conference hosted by the Marion Downs Hearing Center that aimed to share emerging practices in the delivery of hearing services with leading pediatric audiologists and early interventionists.
        </p>

        <p>
            Representatives from pediatric hearing care centers of excellence across the U.S. attended the workshop to learn how the My World tool can introduce play into the counseling session and facilitate communication with children about their hearing loss.  The aim of the workshop was to collaborate on a My World white paper and explore possibilities for a multi-centre study to determine the efficacy of using the tool.

        <h2>New Online Dilemma Cards for Ipad, Tablet and iPhone 
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Dilemma Game consists of a series of dilemma cards that describes challenging real-life scenarios in a clinical setting. 
        </p>
        <p>A new version of the Dilemma Game has been optimized for the iPad and other tablets. It also works well on iPhone5. The game is a great learning tool for professional development and encourages reflection, critical thinking and analysis of the potential consequences that a practitioner's choices may have on patients and their communications partners.  </p>

        <h2>VA Rehabilitation R&amp;D Service Awards Funding for Research on Ida Motivation Tools</h2>
        <p>
            The Rehabilitation R&amp;D Service of the Veterans Administration has awarded funding for a pilot study that will explore whether the Ida Motivation Tools and motivational interviewing techniques can help patients make the behavioral changes necessary to ensure positive hearing aid use. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Samantha Lewis, PhD, staff investigator at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research and assistant professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the Oregon Health and Science University, is the principal investigator for the project, titled "Applying the Use of Motivation Tools to Auditory Rehabilitation." The Motivation Tools will be used as a means to explore and address patient's confidence in hearing aids. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are pleased that the Veteran's Administration has seen the value of conducting research on the potential for positive outcomes with the Motivation Tools, says Ida Managing Director Lise Lotte Bundesen. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ida Institute looks forward to the study results that will help us to provide clinicians with the outcome data needed to further expand use of the Motivation Tools in private and public clinics around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two year study is expected to be completed in 2015.

        <h2>First Ida Quick Tool is Effective for Patient and Practitioner
        </h2>
        <p>
            In early summer, the Ida Institute launched the Living Well Quick Tool. Based on the popular Living Well tool, the new "quick" version is contained on a single sheet, so it is easy to print and give to patients in the waiting room.  
        </p>
        <p>The Living Well Quick Tool is a fast and effective way to open a conversation with patients and learn more about communication situations that are important to them.  The new quick tool can also be sent via email to patients before their consultation. Patients can easily complete the one-page work sheet at home, and come ready to discuss their answers at their appointment.  </p>
